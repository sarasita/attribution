# MESMER-M-TP

This step was carried out using MESMER-M-TP from [MESMER-M-TP](https://github.com/sarasita/mesmer-m-tp.git). 
Data for this study can be re-generated using the output from MAGICC and the calibration setting from the
MESMER-M-TP repository. A detailed explanation on how MESMER-M-TP works is given in the [publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-278).

## Status 
- prototype: the project is just starting up and the code is all prototype

## Output 
- the processed output is available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11086168)

## Steps
We included code for generating temperature emulations as an example in this repository. To avoid duplicating code, refer to [MESMER-M-TP](https://github.com/sarasita/mesmer-m-tp.git) for the rest of the analysis.

## Development News 
We are currently working towards a relase of a streamlined and versionised [MESMER software package](https://github.com/MESMER-group/mesmer.git). This package will include MESMER-M-TP. We will update this repository and provide  examples once the development of the software package is complete.
